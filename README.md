# ISIT330_BI_application_final_project
Final project for business intelligence course (ISIT330: business intelligence application) at Bellevue College

## Final Project: Enrollment Tracker BI Solution Project

### Project Scope
My job was to use a simplified version of the actual OLTP database, which was created by the course instructor, to create a basic example of the BI reporting solution. This basic solution inclued a developer documentation (in the form of an excel spreadsheet), a data warehouse, a SQL ETL script, a SSIS Package that uses the ETL script's code, and some example reports. 

### Project Requirements:
1) SQL Server Data warehouse Script
2) SQL ETL Script
3) SSIS Package
4) Developer Document (Excel Spreadsheet)
5) Demo Reports (Excel and PowerBI)
