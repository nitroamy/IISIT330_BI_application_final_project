# ISIT330_BI_application_final_project
Final project for business intelligence course (ISIT330: business intelligence application) at Bellevue College

## Final Project: Enrollment Tracker BI Solution Project

### Project Scope
My job was to use a simplified version of the actual OLTP database, which was created by the course instructor, to create a basic example of the BI reporting solution. This basic solution inclued a developer documentation (in the form of an excel spreadsheet), a data warehouse, a SQL ETL script, a SSIS Package that uses the ETL script's code, and some example reports. 

### Project Requirements:
1. [SQL Server Data warehouse Script](https://github.com/nitroamy/ISIT330_BI_application_final_project/blob/master/SQLCode/DWEnrollmentTracker%20Database.sql)
2. [SQL ETL Script](https://github.com/nitroamy/ISIT330_BI_application_final_project/blob/master/SQLCode/DWEnrollmentTracker%20ETL.sql)
3. SSIS Package: included in [Visual studio BI solution project](https://github.com/nitroamy/ISIT330_BI_application_final_project/blob/master/EnrollmentTrackerProjects_AmyHong.zip)
4. [Developer Document (Excel Spreadsheet)](https://github.com/nitroamy/ISIT330_BI_application_final_project/blob/master/Documents/EnrollmentTracker.xlsx)
5. [Demo Reports (Excel and PowerBI)](https://github.com/nitroamy/ISIT330_BI_application_final_project/tree/master/Reports)


### Project Timeline:
- Week 1: Design and Begin Documentation
  - The project database called "EnrollmentTracker" was created first. A SQL script was provided by the course instructor to create this initial database
  - A developer design documentation using a Excel spreadsheet was created
  - The design documentation was added to new Visual Studio Solution
- Week 2: Create the Data Warehouse
  - A data warehouse SQL script was created and added to the visual studio solution (which was created in week 1)
- Week 3: Create the ETL Process with SQL and SSIS
  - An ETL script was created and added to the visual studio solution
  - An SSIS project was added and configured in the visual studio solution
- Week 4: Create Reports 
  - The designed document was updated
  - Two sample reports (Excel and PowerBI) were created and added to the visual studio solution
